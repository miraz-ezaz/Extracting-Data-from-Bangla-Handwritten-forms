# Extracting Data from Bangla Handwritten forms using Computer Vision and Optical Character Recognition
 This project aims to automate the process of extracting data from handwritten Bangla forms using Computer Vision and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques. The system employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for character recognition, integrated with a Django backend for handling server-side operations. On the frontend, the application utilizes Python, React, and React Native for user interfaces across web and mobile platforms.
